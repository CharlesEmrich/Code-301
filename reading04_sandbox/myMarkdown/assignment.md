1. Write your own app from scratch that lets the user enter text (you can use <textarea>, <select>, etc.), and covert that text to HTML, with proper handling (conversion) of any markdown contained in that text, and render the HTML.

2. Add a button that, when clicked, causes user-entered text to be converted to HTML (with proper markdown handling) and appends the HTML to the DOM. Repeated clicks of the button will cause repeated copies to be appended.
