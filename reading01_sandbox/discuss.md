Explain one concept from this chapter that was most clear to you. Additionally, what is one question you have from the reading?

I'm surprisingly clear on the way in which jQuery() calls create objects, and the efficacy of saving them to variables as a method of saving memory and time.

I'll refrain from making my question "why didn't we learn this first if it's just better" because I can actually think of a couple of plausible reasons. Instead, how about "just how many commands is it considered correct to chain without line breaks?"

I'm also still not sure what exactly script placement is doing to the timing of JS loading.
